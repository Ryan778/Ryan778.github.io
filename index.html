      <h3>What's this? </h3>
      <p>Well, since you've somehow stumbled here, this is a fairly small site with all of the random and potentially useful tools, gadgets, and other general creations I've made over the years. Who knows, maybe you'll find something that you always wanted but could never find! </p>
      <p><b>Key</b><br/>
        <span class='date'>(Date) • (Tech)</span> - Date refers to when the project was <b>started</b>, not when it was completed/updated. Tech, if listed, refers to any primary libraries/languages used.<br/>
        <i class='txt-wip'></i> - Project not ready for general use. <br/>
        <i class='txt-cur'></i> - Project released to public, and new featuers are actively being worked on. <br/>
        <i class='txt-mt'></i> - Project finished, with no new features planned, only maintenance updates. <br/>
        <i class='txt-dp'></i> - Project no longer maintained. <br/>

      <h3>Main Projects</h3>
      <p><i>Only open-source projects are listed here. You can find my full portfolio on my personal website (currently work in progress, will be linked once completed)</i></p>
      <h4><a href='https://github.com/Ryan778/OpenTrivia'>OpenTrivia</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-wip'></i> - January 2020 • NodeJS + Socket.io</p>
      <p>An all-in-one web application for hosting trivia events. Features a "presentation" page for displaying questions and stats, individual "participant" pages to answer questions, and a "host" page for tracking scores and managing what's displayed. </p>
      <p class='grey-text'>ETA: Fall 2020</p>
      <h4><a href='final-grade-calculator'>Final Grade Calculator</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-mt'></i> - February 2018</p>
      <p>RogerHub is great, but it doesn't work great with complex situations. FGC supports various common test policies (lowest test replaced, dropped, half replaced) and unweighted tests.</p>
      <p>Find out what you need to get on your final in a simple, intuitive interface! </p>
      <h4><a href='https://static.itsryan.org/mscp'>MSCP</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-dp'></i> - May 2017 • Electron</p>
      <p>The Minecraft Server Control Panel. Contact for access; an all-in-one server control panel to make setting up a Minecraft server something so easy even a seven year old could do it (source: was made for that purpose)</p>
      <h4><a href='google-feud-answers'>Google Feud Answers</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-mt'></i> • March 2017</p>
      <p>What's Unique: You won't have to scroll through tens of pages to find what you're looking for!</p>
      <p>Getting distracted in class, but want to one up your friends (or just bored)? Use this!</p>

      <h4><a href='sobvc'>State of Being Verb Checker</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-dp'></i> - December 2016 • CKEditor</p>
      <p>Currently too specific of a thing to exist elsewhere! In the unlikely event that you're required to have zero state of being verbs, this checker will catch all 28 common SOBVs!</p>

      <h3>Side Projects</h3>
      <h4><a href='badui'>Bad UI</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-dp'></i> - Oct 2018-Mar 2019</p>
      <p>A collection of various forms of "Bad UI" I made for fun over the years; many of them are on Reddit (some of which are quite successful - go to r/ProgrammerHumor and sort by top of all time ;)</p>
      <h4><a href='a-social-life'>A Social Life</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-dp'></i> - November 2018 • Materialize</p>
      <p>My final project for my first semester 10th grade English class.</p>
      <h4><a href='flop'>Flop</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-mt'></i> - July 2017 • Vanilla JS</p>
      <p>Flop?</p>
      <h4><a href='bkmusic'>BKMusic</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-dp'></i> - June 2017 • JScript</p>
      <p>Provides scripts to discreetly play music on your victim's computer. Some audio files no longer work.</p>
      <h4><a href='kevinspin'>Kevin Spin</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-dp'></i> - May 2017 • Vanilla JS</p>
      <p>Like Taco Spin or Leek Spin, but with a guy (whose name is, unsurprisingly, Kevin) spinning around instead.</p>
      <h4><a href='https://anxietysteps.github.io/'>Anxiety Steps</a></h4>
      <p class='date'><i class='txt-dp'></i> - November 2016</p>
      <p>Imagine a small group of seventh and eighth graders trying to make a website to do something in 24 hours. Well, this was what we came up with. (Also the only project on here that was a group project... and my first introduction to GitHub!)</p>

      <h3>More <span class='grey-text'>(other random stuff)</span></h3>
      <h4>My <a href='about-me'>About Me Page</a></h4>
      <p>(the above page will also give links to my first CS projects on Khan and more!)</p>
      <h4>The <a href='old'>Original Homepage</a></h4>
      <p>A "homepage" that wasn't really a homepage, and more of a placeholder shouting "check out these random things!"<br>Ok, maybe this homepage isn't that much different but this one's actually complete!</p>
      <h4>My <a href='linktree'>Instagram "Linktree"</a></h4>
      <p>Linktree managed to get wildly successful, but (reasonably so) puts top features behind a paywall. Didn't like the limitations of linktr.ee free, so I made my own. </p>
      <h4>My <a href='https://ryan778.herokuapp.com'>Heroku Server</a></h4>
      <p>Not currently maintained. Has some fun secrets, like <a href='https://ryan778.herokuapp.com/personal/codekeeper'>CodeKeeper</a> (want to poke at? there's a <span data-code='MATH5864663'>code</span> hidden in this page's source code... note that the "reward" no longer does anything)</p>
