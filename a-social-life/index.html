      <h2>Hi! I'm Ryan. </h2>
      <p class='lg'>How's your social life?<br>Is there anything you wanted to change but couldn't?</p><hr/><p>Is there even a point in listening to a stranger that you don't know on the internet? </p>
      <p class='sm'>This is not a blog post, nor a life story that takes forever to read, nor is it a bland, meaningless article. <br>This is something new I'm trying, something that hopefully won't bore you to death. Willing to try it out? Scroll down!</p>

      <p class='lg'><b>Some Backstory</b></p>
      <p class='sm'><i>(that's really short and to the point)</i></p>
      <p class='sm'>In fifth grade, I had one friend who I knew thanks to our parents' relation, and that friend managed to make a couple more friends, which I tagged along with. <br>In sixth grade, I went to middle school with the few friends I had, and they made more friends, which joined our group. <br>By eighth grade, our group was fairly large with around eight people, and life was fine. Three of my friends were going to the same high school I was going to, and I could tag along some more. Right?</p>
      <p class='sm'><b>Of course that didn't happen.</b> In a turn of events, none of them ended up with me. One person went to the other neighboring school, and the others actually moved out of town. Turns out, it's hard to tag along with someone when you don't have anyone to do so!</p>

      <p class='sm'>Just a tad bit more of backstory - I was in a fairly high math class at that time such that most of my classmates were a grade or two higher. Some of these people were really smart and really social, and they talked to me! Amazing!</p>
      <p class='sm'>If you paid close attention to the chart, you may have noticed that there was a small discrepancy between what I said and the data on the chart. So, what if we removed all of the super-social upper classmen that knew me?</p>

      <p class='lg'>As you may or may not have already figured out, but extra-cirricular activites are pretty valuable. </p>
      <p class='sm int1-res2A'>And since you're already in a few, whether it's because of peer pressure or because you're genuinely interested (or a combination of these two), you at least do care about what you're doing (hopefully!)</p>
      <p class='sm int1-res2B'>While you're not heavily involved yet, you have probably heard from teachers, counselors, etc. about how important clubs are. </p>
      <p class='sm'>But how important are clubs? How much time do you, or would you really spend on them? Let's find out! </p>
      <p class='sm gr'>You likely (whether you'd admit it or not) know that actually spending time with other people is pretty much one of, if not the only way to make new friends. </p>

        <p class='nm sm'>Feel free to enter in your current situation, or an ideal situation. </p>

      <p class='lg'>Pretty significant now, isn't it? </p>
      <p class='sm'>If you had <b class='int2_res_comp' data-factor='1'>0</b> <b>hours</b>, you could watch, say, Coco <b class='int2_res_comp' data-factor='1.81667'>0</b> <b>complete times</b> (w/ credits!).</p>

      <p class='sm gr'>(Nor would I recommend doing any of these things that many times.)</p>
      <p>That aside, think about the end goal of this:</p>
      <p class='sm'>With that much time, you can really form a close bond with the people doing the same thing that you're doing!</p>
      <p class='sm'>Think about it. How long does it take for you to get to know someone in your class? A few weeks, maybe a month or two? The same would apply to extra-cirricular activites, except you have the added benefit of sharing the same thing in that club, sport, etc!</p>

      <p class='sm'>Now consider leading or starting a club on your own!</p>
      <p class='sm'>I know firsthand that it can be a terrifying thought, trying to lead other students over something that you're passionate about, not knowing whether anyone else cares or not. Despite this, this is something <b>you</b> should consider doing!</p>

      <p>So what happened next (for me)?</p>

  <div id='s10' class='slide'>
    <div class='container'>
      <p>As it turns out, leadership is not something people are simply born with. </p>
      <p class='sm'>Some people may be slighly more social and better off at this than others, but this is nonetheless something that requires practice. </p>
      <p>So why am I saying this? </p>
      <p class='sm'>I know that both things (starting high school without friends and also going far enough to start and lead a club) have happened to me! <br>And while part of this page is a backstory about me, it really leads down to what <b>you</b> are able to do given the effort. </p>
      <p class='sm'>(If you checked everything) While you're really social (or simply lying), you clearly seem to be doing fine. </p>
      <p>Of course, don't let social skills get in the way of everything else!</p>
      <p class='sm'>While it's very helpful to have such skills in life, don't let academics or anything else get pushed aside for the sake of this. It's not worth it!<br>That said, having strong social and interpersonal skills will help you out in the future! Is this sounding like a generic pep-talk now? Well, I'll need to fix that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
