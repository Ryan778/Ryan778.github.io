# [Ryan778.github.io](https://ryan778.github.io)
Hi there! This is my personal GitHub repository for maintaining my GitHub website. There's not much to do here, nor does this repository get much traffic (at least, for now), but feel free to poke around and what not!

## Contributing
Contributions aren't expected as this is more of a personal repository, but if there's something I missed or you think will help, feel free to make a pull request! See the **Licensing** section for more information and legal stuff. 

## Licensing
This repository, strictly speaking, is **not open source** as it's not given out under an open-source license. In the event that a copy of this site pops up somewhere else and is siphoning off traffic, appropirate legal actions may be taken. **However**, many projects that I do and put on here for hosting **are open source** in the (very unlikely) event that someone wants to help out or contribute. Please use common sense - taking an open source sub-project from this repository to change and/or remix is completely fine, taking the entire repository and rehosting it on your own domain is not. 

The reason that this entire repository isn't made open source (as in, you can take the code and reuse it) for the time being is that ~~there is neither traffic (with the exception of traffic from [open source Reddit memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/9ozauu/a_more_accurate_representation_of_what_happened/)) nor is there a need for it (who else would benefit from my [about me](https://ryan778.github.io/about-me) page?)~~ it was once very quiet and I figured there'd be no point... and it seems [that is no longer the case](https://static.itsryan.org/images/wait-there-are-views.png)... oops. I'll keep it the same for now: **please reach out and contact me** if you're interested in using something and I'll almost certainly be perfectly fine with it *(exceptions include, but are not limited to: blatantly rehosting the same pages elsewhere, commercializing my (free) stuff without substantial changes, etc)*. Now that I have [my own domain](https://www.itsryan.org), I'll slowly start separating open-source, static pages (which'll be here!) and closed-source and/or dynamic pages requiring server interaction (which'll be there!) to clear things up. 

## More Information
I don't really mind people saving and/or forking data from this repository - it's on GitHub for a reason! My personal projects are hosted on [Heroku](https://ryan778.herokuapp.com) and other private servers, so almost anything that is found on this repository is intended to be spread and shared to the world. 

If you are interested in taking something that's not yet given out in an open source license for your own project, please contact me! For most cases I wouldn't mind at all, and I'm just curious to know what you're doing (as stated above). Thanks!
