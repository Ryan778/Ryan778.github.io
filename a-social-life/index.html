      <h2>Hi! I'm Ryan. </h2>
      <p class='lg'>How's your social life?<br><hr/></p>
      <p class='sm'><i>A Social Life</i> was my 10th grade English "self-study" project to make something that's both creative and helpful to other people. <br/><br/>Looking back now, I still find the creative aspect to be quite interesting; I've always wanted to make something that's both helpful yet more engaging than merely, say, reading a book or a blog post. However, it also leaned heavily into my own life, to the point that it's a bit much. Had I had the opportunity to combine the artistic and web side with someone who could actually give a motivational speech, it'd probably turn out a lot better. Nonetheless, it was a fun and educational experience, and I'm keeping it up in the event someone's interested in taking a look.</p>
