# [Ryan778.github.io](https://ryan778.github.io)
Hi there! This is my personal GitHub repository for maintaining my GitHub website. There's not much to do here, nor does this repository get much traffic (at least, for now), but feel free to poke around and what not!

## Contributing
Contributions aren't expected as this is more of a personal repository, but if there's something I missed or you think will help, feel free to make a pull request! See the **Licensing** section for more information and legal stuff. 

## Licensing
This repository, strictly speaking, is **not open source** as it's not given out under an open-source license. However, many projects that I do and put on here for hosting **are open source** in the unlikely event that someone wants to help out or contribute. 

The reason that this entire repository isn't made open source (as in, you can take the code and reuse it) for the time being is that there is neither traffic (with the exception of traffic from [open source Reddit memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/9ozauu/a_more_accurate_representation_of_what_happened/)) nor is there a need for it (who else would benefit from my [about me](https://ryan778.github.io/about-me) page?) 

However, if you are interested in taking something that's not yet given out in an open source license for your own project, please contact me! For most cases I wouldn't mind at all, and I just want to know what you're doing. Thanks!
